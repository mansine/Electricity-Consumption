The dataset (Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), 2012) accumulated in this research paper is obtained from the Irish Social Science Data Archive (ISSDA), 
with only one restriction that this data can only be used not more than three people at a time. First big smart meter trial taken place by Irish Commission 
for Energy Regulation's (CER) between 2009 to 2010 which included around 5000 Irish households and some small businesses. This data has been accumulated by 
Smart meter trials.That smart metering program began in 2007 mostly with aim of determining the effect of smart meters on households' electricity use in 
intended to notify the cost-benefit analysis of a nationwide launch (ISSDA, 2011). Bord Gais Energy consumers were among the residents and business owners who 
took part in the proceedings.All of them ready to install these smart meters inside their premises after the smart meter trials.The data from the smart metering 
project was made public in order to "facilitate future research and innovation of goods and services in the aftermath of the planned introduction of smart meters 
in Ireland".There is no sensitive or confidential information in the dataset. Half-hourly observations of smart meters in Kilowatt-hour (kWh) of participant households 
and small businesses make up the anonymized results.Six zip files containing approximately twenty million records.Given the scope of this study, the rows of data available
in each of the six files, as well as the total rows of data available in the combined six files (more than 120 million rows), is excessive. Furthermore, predicting millions
of dataset at the same time would be overkilling the problem and would necessitate an excessive amount of computing capacity.As a result, each of the six data files was 
analyzed with the intention of deciding which meter ID had the most data rows. With 25,920 rows of data, the meter ID 1208 in the first file (File1.txt) had the highest number.
Hence File1.txt file having Meter ID'S having highest rows of data around 2,44,65,838 is used for this research paper.
